vaadin-phonegap-integration
===========================

This is a demo project to integrate Vaadin and PhoneGap

- config.xml: the configuration file for PhoneGap
- index.html: the html page which PhoneGap renders in native app
- ExampleApp: example Vaadin application which is wrapped by PhoneGap (This can be exluded from the PhoneGap project)
- VAADIN: static resources (widgetsets, theme) which is bundled with the PhoneGap
- PING: workaround for an issue described in [ticket](http://dev.vaadin.com/ticket/14035)

Another approach to do the integration was also tried. There is still some files related to that but those can be ignored at the moment.
- config_externalURL: configuration file where index.html file is external 
- ExampleApp/WebContent/www: PhoneGap project build for Android
